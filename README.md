# GemLookup :detective:

Uses inline Bundler and the [`typhoeus` :gem:][typhoeus] to make parallel requests to the public
RubyGems API.

## Installation

```sh
$ gem install gem_lookup
```

### Design

The idea behind `gem_lookup` is that you'll call the it using the `gems` executable coommand. It
should be used when you are doing maintenance and project upgrades. It will be able to answer
questions the [RubyGems website][rubygems site] can.

```sh
gems
```

Then it can be used instead anywhere by calling `gems` instead of having to directly
reference `gems.rb`.

### Help

Pass `-h` or `--help` to get help.

```sh
$ gems --help            
```

### Pass It Some Gems

Since it sends requests in parallel, the order you pass gems in may not be the order in which
you see the results. 

#### Formatting

The list of gems are lowercased, and then de-duped. So don't worry if you pass in any
capitalization or duplicate gems; It's got you covered. :sparkling_heart:

#### Output

You're going to get lots of emojis to identify info, and a small variety of colors depending
on whether certain criteria are met for the line. It also looks even better with font ligatures
enabled, so if your font and/or terminal support them, it is recommended to enable them.

#### The Basics

Just pass it a gem name.

```sh
$ ./gems.rb pry
=> 🔎 Looking up: pry
=> 💎 pry is at 0.14.1

==> 🏠 http://pry.github.io
==> 🔗 https://github.com/pry/pry
==> 📑 https://github.com/pry/pry/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
```

#### Standard Mode

Since there is a [rate limit](#rate-limit), passing less gems than that will cause it to run in
`Standard` mode:

```sh
$ ./gems.rb pry rspec sentry-ruby rails
=> ✨ Gems: 4
=> 🔎 Looking up: pry, rspec, sentry-ruby, rails

==> 📑 https://github.com/rails/rails/releases/tag/v6.1.3.2
```

#### Batch Mode

When more gems are passed in than the [rate limit](#rate-limit) supports, the script will enter
`Batch` mode. In this mode, the output is slightly different, and there is a **one second** pause
between batches, so as to respect the rate limit.

```sh

#### Non-Existent Gems

If a gem isn't found, the output will be a little bit different: that particular line will be
red. It's also important to know that not finding a gem doesn't block other gems from being looked
up.

```sh
$ ./gems.rb non-existent rails
=> ✨ Gems: 2
=> 🔎 Looking up: non-existent, rails
=> 💎 non-existent not found
=> 💎 rails is at 6.1.3.2
==> 📅 May 5, 2021
==> 🏠 https://rubyonrails.org
==> 🔗 https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/v6.1.3.2
==> 📑 https://github.com/rails/rails/releases/tag/v6.1.3.2
```
